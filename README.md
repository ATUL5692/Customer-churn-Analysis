This project, titled “KPMG Data Analysis using Excel”, was completed as part of a data analytics course focused on mastering Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The objective was to derive business insights from customer demographics, transaction history, and potential new customer data provided in a fictional KPMG dataset. Across six structured tasks, the project involved cleaning and merging data, segmenting customers, analyzing sales and product performance, estimating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and providing strategic recommendations. All analyses were performed using advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, RANK, and QUARTILE, along with pivot tables and visualizations. A final video walkthrough of the entire project was also created to present insights and outcomes.
